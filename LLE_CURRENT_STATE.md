# LLE Current State

> **BOOTSTRAPPED AT MAIN `e2011da19ee0a08582a52c43aa9cdefbf8ee613b`**
>
> Bootstrap date: `2026-08-29`. This records the first Current State
> baseline and does not imply that historical Current State entries existed.

## 1. Purpose and Authority Boundary

This file is the compact operational status ledger for LLE. It records the
currently accepted repository baseline, milestone state, pinned evidence,
open findings, lifecycle boundaries, and exactly one next action. It is not
a duplicate of `ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATION_BACKLOG.md` and does not silently
create or change a canonical contract.

Authority precedence, highest first:

1. Latest explicit user approval
2. Approved Tier A canonical authority
3. Approved Tier C clarification/backlog authority
4. Exact remote Git `main` and commit-pinned evidence

This ledger does not supersede the canonical documents, detailed backlog, or
specialized project-status authorities. If it conflicts with applicable
canonical authority or exact remote Git evidence, operational status is
`BLOCKED` until the conflict is explicitly reconciled.

## 2. Repository Bootstrap Baseline

- Repository: `minos8458-web/language-learning-engine`
- Default branch: `main`
- Observed pre-bootstrap `origin/main`: `e2011da19ee0a08582a52c43aa9cdefbf8ee613b`
- Tree: `e420dbfda7403717390b3933b89fb014a5d49ff6`
- Parent: `66c4b68ec81e5cf8eeb550b2ff269518de5b008c`
- Subject: `Record VI P1 raw source rebuild documentation review`

## 3. Backlog Baseline

- File: `ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATION_BACKLOG.md`
- Latest revision: `1.69`
- Blob: `e8bccf7bdbc5476f606192debca9e3dffeb67f53`
- Revision `1.69`: present exactly once
- Revision `1.70`: absent

The detailed revision 1.69 lifecycle record remains in the backlog and is not
duplicated here.

## 4. Current Milestone

- Milestone: VI P1 Measurement Readiness — Runtime Foundation B1 Raw Source
  Rebuild CORE canonical documentation contract
- State: `REVIEW-RECORDED / CANONICAL ON MAIN / POST-MERGE VERIFIED`
- Lifecycle scope: documentation only
- Runtime Foundation B1 implementation: `NOT IMPLEMENTED`
- `queryRawEvidenceForMetricRebuild(pool, input)` runtime: `ABSENT`
- Previous Foundation A item-exposure/item-lineage state:
  `REVIEW-RECORDED / CANONICAL IMPLEMENTATION ON MAIN / POST-MERGE VERIFIED`
- Foundation A backlog revision: `1.68`

## 5. Validation Branch and Canonical Artifacts

- Separate correction and current validation tip:
  `f982f6faee8f89aa6734e36377e95b1fb32a01a7`

## 6. Latest Actual Runtime Evidence

Evidence source: B1 post-merge evidence recorded in backlog revision `1.69`.
This bootstrap does not rerun PostgreSQL or tests.

- PostgreSQL server: `17.10`
- Isolated database: `lle_pm_b1_raw_source_20260829104004_939`
- Focused results:
  - dbPool: `2/2 PASS`
  - migrations: `14/14 PASS`
  - Evidence migration: `24/24 PASS`
- Full regression:
  - suites: `54`
  - tests: `374`
  - pass: `374`
  - fail: `0`
  - cancelled: `0`
  - skipped: `0`
  - todo: `0`
- Schema:
  - repository migrations: `001–013`
  - `schema_migrations`: `13`
  - migration `014`: absent
  - Evidence tables: `17`
- Temporary database cleanup: `PASS`
- `lle_dev`: untouched

## 7. Provider, Mock, and Independent Review Status

- Mock: existing first Mock composition only; it is not actual-provider
  evidence.
- Actual provider: incomplete and not authorized.
- Audio/raw-audio path: not authorized.
- Original B1 review: `REQUEST CORRECTION`.
- Corrected-tip re-review: `APPROVE WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES`.
- Correction required after re-review: `NO`.
- Owner value required: `NO`.
- Main-integration eligibility: `ELIGIBLE`.
- Final B1 documentation lifecycle:
  `REVIEW-RECORDED / CANONICAL ON MAIN / POST-MERGE VERIFIED`.

## 8. Open Findings

- B1 review blockers: BLOCKER `0`; HIGH `0`.
- B1 non-blocking findings `F-B1-08–F-B1-26`:
  MEDIUM `2`; LOW `6`; NOTE `11`.
- `F-B1-25` remains OPEN: pre-existing stale Schema §5.9.1
  migration-012/16-table wording. It is not resolved by this bootstrap.
- Foundation A findings remain OPEN/non-blocking:
  `F-R02`, `F-N01`, and `F-R03–F-R13`.
- Product activation dependency `B-3` remains `UNRESOLVED`.

## 9. Lifecycle Non-Claims

This ledger does not claim:

- Runtime Foundation B1 implemented
- `queryRawEvidenceForMetricRebuild(pool, input)` runtime exists
- VI P1 Measurement Readiness complete
- `B-3` resolved
- P1 eligible or activated
- human-data collection authorized
- efficacy verified
- GitHub Actions PASS
- Validation Level 3 §10 overall PASS
- Evidence Foundation overall complete
- actual provider or audio authorized
- any open finding resolved

## 10. Next Action

- After this bootstrap commit is present on `origin/main` and the exact Git
  baseline is rechecked, start a separately scoped Runtime Foundation B1
  implementation task limited to the approved
  `queryRawEvidenceForMetricRebuild(pool, input)` RAW_SOURCE CORE contract.
