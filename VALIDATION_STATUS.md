# Validation Level 3 — Validation State Authority

This document is the **sole owner** of Validation State for the project. `BOOTSTRAP.md` and `PROJECT_MASTER_INDEX.md` do not duplicate validation figures — they point here.

## A. Current Validation Ledger

This ledger distinguishes the following identities. Git ref, runtime-validated implementation, independent review target, and review-record commit are separate authorities and are not merged into a single "current implementation SHA".

- **Ledger snapshot baseline**: `1719749ff90bbdb326cdd12399475206b7088ca4`
- **GitHub main ref**: `GitHub refs/heads/main` (authority for current repository HEAD; no hard-coded SHA in this document replaces it)
- **Last runtime-validated implementation**: `593b5a4a11fb394a3db6b47a56e2d7b6ceccda0e`
- **Independent review target**: `30db1b98fc8ec02f4b9f91def0d4c4577c0bbf0f`
- **Current review-record commit**: `e60b2fc7c88fd0d3173adc94a541b4b19dcc98c8` (`ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATION_BACKLOG.md` revision 1.41)

### A.1 Validation Level State

- **Validation Level 3 §9 Conversation Boundary: PASS.** The full evidence chain and acceptance-criteria reconciliation supporting this PASS are preserved unchanged in §B.1 (historical detail; not superseded).
- **Validation Level 3 §10 overall: NOT DECLARED.**

Code/artifact presence is a separate claim from validation PASS. The two are not conflated.

### A.2 Evidence Foundation Bounded Runtime Evidence

**Last runtime-validated implementation**: `593b5a4a11fb394a3db6b47a56e2d7b6ceccda0e`

**Environment**:

- Windows PowerShell 5.1
- PostgreSQL 17.10
- Node.js 24.18.0
- npm 11.16.0

**Evidence database**:

- evidence tables: 16
- highest migration: 012
- migration 013: absent

**Focused test result**:

- tests 64, suites 1, pass 64, fail 0, cancelled 0, skipped 0, todo 0

**Full test result**:

- tests 324, suites 52, pass 324, fail 0, cancelled 0, skipped 0, todo 0

This is the bounded Evidence Foundation P0 finalization writer runtime-validation record. It does not declare Evidence Foundation overall complete.

### A.3 Independent Review Evidence

- **Reviewed commit**: `30db1b98fc8ec02f4b9f91def0d4c4577c0bbf0f`
- **Verdict**: APPROVE WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES
- **Severity**: BLOCKER 0 / HIGH 0 / MEDIUM 0 / LOW 1 / NOTE 3
- **Preserved finding**: F-L01 — non-blocking

### A.4 GitHub-Hosted Evidence

- Combined commit status: absent
- Current HEAD workflow run: absent
- Permanent `.github/workflows`: absent

This absence reflects that main does not retain a permanent CI workflow. It is separate from, and does not diminish, the Windows-local runtime validation recorded in §A.2. Absence of GitHub Actions evidence is not classified as a runtime failure.

### A.5 Explicit Non-Declarations

- AC-017 CLOSED
- AC-017 IMPLEMENTED
- AC-018 CLOSED
- AC-018 IMPLEMENTED
- Validation Level 3 §10 overall PASS
- actual-provider milestone complete
- Evidence Foundation overall complete
- VI pilot efficacy verified
- Beta Release ready
- user app complete
- VI Empirical Pilot P1 activated
- human-data collection approved

### A.6 B-5/B-4 Governance Documentation Review (no new runtime evidence)

- **Candidate commits**: `d75b518c01724059b45f6adc1a93b602c86a69c4` (B-5), `542c6b5004bbffed570aefcb1a3a858655206bb7` (B-4)
- **Main integration**: `37eb97a295df10bfd4d48ab06e13be20c85c3beb`, `4305eb4a3ccf294f9f35efb4a3ef1574e9c8e143`
- **Review-record candidate/main**: `ca31ff6486a22780aa7aedf44c3c00b8aefb26b2` / `e60b2fc7c88fd0d3173adc94a541b4b19dcc98c8`
- **Verdict**: APPROVE WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES; BLOCKER/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW 0, NOTE 2 (G-N01, G-N02); ELIGIBLE
- This is a documentation-only governance review, distinct from the §A.3 entry for `30db1b98fc8ec02f4b9f91def0d4c4577c0bbf0f`. It adds, changes, or supersedes no runtime test evidence. `Last runtime-validated implementation` remains `593b5a4a11fb394a3db6b47a56e2d7b6ceccda0e`, and §A.2's focused (64/64) and full (324/324) test results are unchanged.

## B. Historical Validation Records

### B.1 §9 Conversation Boundary — Full Evidence Chain

The following is the full §9 Conversation Boundary evidence chain and acceptance-criteria reconciliation, preserved unchanged. It is the factual support for the current §A.1 "§9 PASS" status and is not superseded.

**Reference commit / verified implementation baseline**: `83b3fa56f6c56d34cdb07e26162749bb0744f6f5`

**Validation Level 3 §9 Conversation Boundary: PASS** (2026-07-22).

The verified implementation baseline contains the production Learning Flow five-branch decision path and production client boundary controller. AC-012, AC-014, AC-015, and AC-016 are all Architecture Clarification **RESOLVED** / Prerequisite Implementation **CLOSED**.

Code/artifact presence is a separate claim from validation PASS. The two are not conflated.

#### B.1.1 §9 Evidence Chain

-   Server main implementation: `fff9d93e3822c187e9e8fd68bd75e810880f6954`
-   Server main correction: `33a36dea2f2e9b342e97c473bd0fce8056d67fac`
-   Server independent review record: `92b4319fb7794a9fb0d03537c01e5781a29dbb9c` — **APPROVE WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES**, BLOCKER/CRITICAL/MAJOR 0
-   Server validation evidence: Actions run `29748289860`, 183/183 PASS, 39 suites, PostgreSQL 16.14 / Node.js 20.20.2
-   Client validation implementation/evidence: `c8cff69a136b8259d5f18cd41256dcb478afe61d` / `3e7edb637f13444a51c2d181e3ac9fb7f6e57ff7`
-   Client main implementation/evidence: `910835ab381aa3e5c5549dba04a4d55707ed6a10` / `83b3fa56f6c56d34cdb07e26162749bb0744f6f5`
-   Client independent review: **APPROVE WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES**, BLOCKER/CRITICAL/MAJOR 0
-   Post-merge verification branch: `vl3-section9-postmerge-validation-20260722`
-   Workflow-only commit: `18a028fbf2e88aaea05e66ab450c18127691e8b3`
-   GitHub Actions run `29874075409`: 191/191 PASS, 40 suites, fail/cancelled/skipped/todo 0, PostgreSQL 16.14 / Node.js 20.20.2
-   The post-merge branch tree excluding `.github/workflows/postgresql-tests.yml` is byte-identical to verified implementation main `83b3fa56f6c56d34cdb07e26162749bb0744f6f5`; main does not contain the temporary workflow.

#### B.1.2 §9 Acceptance Criteria Reconciliation

| Canonical criterion | PASS evidence |
|---|---|
| 진입 조건 트리거 | Production `startSession`이 조건 충족 시 exact `{next_action:"CONVERSATION"}`을 반환함을 server PostgreSQL validation 183/183과 post-merge 191/191에서 확인 |
| 클라이언트 표시 | Production controller가 오류·빈 화면이 아닌 정상 `CONVERSATION_BOUNDARY` screen state를 반환함을 client E2E에서 확인 |
| 세션 흐름 유지 | 화면 확인 후 in-memory acknowledgement=true, `startSession(..., true)` 재호출, 서버의 다음 유효 action 소비까지 확인 |
| acknowledgement omitted / false | 세 진입 조건 충족 시 CONVERSATION 반환 확인 |
| acknowledgement true | 같은 호출에서 CONVERSATION을 제외하고 기존 우선순위의 다음 유효 action 반환 확인 |
| acknowledgement null / non-boolean | `CONTRACT_VIOLATION` 전달 및 client error state, 자동 재호출 없음 확인 |
| acknowledgement lifecycle | 명시적 확인 전 false, 확인 뒤 현재 controller/session memory에서 true, 새 controller/session에서 false 초기화 확인 |
| capacity-race 재판정 | `startSession → startExplicitStudy(CONTRACT_VIOLATION) → fresh startSession` 각 1회와 최신 authoritative action 수신 확인 |
| 전체 client boundary DB write 0 | 왕복 전후 9개 테이블의 row count와 row digest 동일, 생성·수정·삭제 0 확인 |
| 구현 선행조건 | REVIEW / NEW_GRAMMAR / INTERLEAVING / CONVERSATION / IDLE 다섯 production branch, exact-key payload, admission error 보존 확인 |

Conversation Engine 내부 설계·대화 품질과 실제 UI binding은 `VALIDATION_LEVEL3.md` §2.2 및 §9에 따라 이 PASS 판정 범위 밖이다. Production controller의 `SCREEN_KIND`/state model 경계까지만 검증 대상으로 인정한다.

### B.2 Historical Validation Record — Prior-session Codebase

⚠️ **Warning**:

This result belongs to a prior-session codebase and is not evidence that the current GitHub main has passed the same validation scope.

These results are preserved for historical continuity only and must not be cited as current-main validation evidence. Its "§9 In Progress" and 260/260 figures are historical only and do not override the current §9 PASS evidence in §B.1.
